# 📊 Dataset Source

This project uses the **Goodreads Books Dataset** available on Kaggle:

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jealousleopard/goodreadsbooks

## Dataset Description

The dataset was created to provide a **clean and structured collection of book information** suitable for data analysis and recommendation systems.

Many existing book datasets contain:

* Missing important attributes
* Poorly structured data
* Multiple fragmented files

To solve this problem, the dataset author used the **Goodreads API** to extract and clean book information into a single structured dataset containing useful numerical and categorical features.

The dataset includes information such as:

* Book title
* Authors
* Average rating
* Rating counts
* Publication year
* Publisher
* ISBN
* Language code
* Number of pages

These structured attributes make the dataset well-suited for:

* Data analysis
* Recommendation systems
* Rating analytics
* Book popularity insights
